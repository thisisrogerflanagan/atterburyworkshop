      <h2>About</h2>
      <p class="opening">
        Supply &amp; design since 2023. Atterbury is a small, but mighty studio,
        sign foundry, and goods shop created by accidental-entrepreneur and
        <a class="bigfoot" href="#">Sasquatch believer</a>, Roger Flanagan. We
        make original signs and prints for people like you. Handmade in Northern
        Kentucky.
      </p>

        Youâ€™re here because you have a vision, a big idea. Our purpose is to
        help our customers connect in a meaningful and memorable way with their
        purchase; whether it's concepting invitations for your 10-year-olds
        birthday party or creating an epic comemorative poster for Nana's banana
        bread recipe. We use our unique style and Swiss-army-skillset to craft
        handmade quality goods big and small.

        <p class="last">
          Greetings from the Bluegrass state. Besides designing, sign builds,
          and business as usual, he's fond of snapping pics on his Contax G2,
          pretending to make websites in VS Code, chuckling along to Earwolf
          podcasts, and prowling the local swap meets looking for vintage wall
          art. Dad in real life.
