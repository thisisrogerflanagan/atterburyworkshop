        <h3>General Order Questions</h3>
        <p>
            <span>I have a question about an order or product. Who do I contact?</span>
            Please contact us at help@simplebits.com. Get in touch with us Monday–Friday from 9am–5pm EST — we work hard to get back to everyone within 48 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Can I call you with a question?</span>
          We don’t offer phone support—please send us an email with your question(s). We love email.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Help! I ordered the wrong size. Can I change the size before it ships?</span>
          We’re unable to change sizing once the order is placed. If you’d like a different size, we can cancel/refund your current order and you will need to place a new one. Please email help@simplebits.com with the subject line “Cancel Order” and include your order number in the subject line as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>I’m looking for an item that I don’t see listed in the shop.  Is the item available?</span>
          All items listed in the shop are what we currently have available for purchase.  Keep checking back for new gear!
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>I want to purchase an item but I don’t see my size. Can you print just one in my size?</span>
          All sizes currently offered will be listed in the shop. If your size is out of stock, it should be restocked soon!
        </p>

        <h3>Shipping</h3>
        <p>
          <span>How long does it take for my order to ship?</span>
          We make every effort to get your order to you as quickly as possible. Most orders ship in 1-3 business days from when order was placed. We ship Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. During high volume season(s), orders may take longer to process. Once your order has shipped, you will receive a shipment confirmation e-mail with tracking. Please allow at least 1 business day for the tracking to update.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Do you ship internationally?</span>
          Yes, we do! We currently use USPS but hope to offer better rates and services in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Do you offer expedited shipping options?</span>
          We do offer USPS Priority shipping which will arrive in 2-3 days. Orders placed before 12PM EST (business days only) are shipped out the same day; orders placed after 12PM EST are shipped the next day. Most Priority orders ship in 1 business day.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Can I change my shipping address?</span>
          If your order has not yet been shipped, we will make every effort to change it! Please send an email to help@simplebits.com as soon as possible with the subject line “Change Shipping Address” to inquire about changing your shipping address.  Please make sure to include your order number for faster service.
        </p>

        <h3>Tracking</h3>
        <p>
          <span>When will I receive my order?</span>
          We make every effort to get your order to you as quickly as possible. Once shipped, most domestic orders will arrive in 4-7 business days for standard delivery. International orders can take 2-12 weeks for final delivery. Certain countries are subject to longer transit times.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>How can I track my order?</span>
          We will send you a tracking number directly to the email address you used upon placing your order. The email with the tracking number is separate from your order confirmation email and you will receive it once the order has been shipped. Please check your spam folder for this notification — if for some reason you don’t receive it within 4 business days of order placement, please send us an email with the subject line “Tracking Inquiry” to help@simplebits.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>My tracking status has not updated. What’s going on with my order?</span>
          USPS tracking updates are not always updated in real time.  Please keep checking your tracking status for one week and you should start to see updates! After a week, if you don’t see an update please send us an e-mail with the subject line “Tracking Inquiry” to help@simplebits.com.
        </p>

          <span>Can I return/exchange an item?</span>
          We want you to be happy with your purchase! You may return any unworn, unwashed item within 30 days from receiving your order for either an exchange or a full refund.

          Please send the unworn, unwashed item(s) to the address listed below — fill out the packing slip that is located inside the package and send the form along with your item to:

        </p>
        <p>
          <span>How can I cancel my order?</span>
          As long as your order has not shipped, we can cancel your order! Please send an email to help@simplebits.com with the subject line “Cancel Order” and include your order # in the subject line — we’ll take care of that for you. Refunds are transferred back to the original form of payment and will be processed within 48–72 hours of cancellation notification.
