      <h3>General Order Questions</h3>
      <h4>I have a question about an order or product. Who do I contact?</h4>
      <p>
        <b> Please</b> contact us at mail@atterburyworkshop.com. Get in touch
        with us Monday-Friday from 9am-5pm EST — we work hard to get back to
        everyone within 48 hours.
      </p>
      <h4>Can I call you with a question?</h4>
      <p>
        We don't offer phone support&#8212;please send us an email with your
        question(s). We love email.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Help! I ordered the wrong size. Can I change the size before it ships?
      </h4>
      <p>
        We're unable to change sizing once the order is placed. If you'd like a
        different size, we can cancel/refund your current order and you will
        need to place a new one. Please email mail@atterburyworkshop.co with the
        subject line “Cancel Order” and include your order number in the subject
        line as well.
      </p>
      <h4>
        I'm looking for an item that I don't see listed in the shop. Is the item
        available?
      </h4>
      <p>
        All items listed in the shop are what we currently have available for
        purchase. Keep checking back for new gear!
      </p>
      <h3>Shipping</h3>
      <h4>How long does it take for my order to ship?</h4>
      <p>
        We make every effort to get your order to you as quickly as possible.
        Most orders ship in 1-3 business days from completion date. You will
        receive an email once we begin production. We ship Monday through
        Friday, excluding holidays. During high volume season(s), orders may
        take longer to process. Once your order has shipped, you will receive a
        shipment confirmation e-mail with tracking. Please allow at least 1
        business day for the tracking to update.
      </p>
      <h4>Do you offer expedited shipping options?</h4>
      <p>
        We do offer USPS Priority shipping which will arrive in 2-3 days. If you
        are interested in expedited shipping please let us know within 24 hours
        after your order is placed.
      </p>
      <h4>Can I change my shipping address?</h4>
      <p>
        If your order has not yet been shipped, we will make every effort to
        change it! Please send an email to mail@atterburyworkshop.com as soon as
        possible with the subject line “Change Shipping Address” to inquire
        about changing your shipping address. Please make sure to include your
        order number for faster service.
      </p>
      <h3>Tracking</h3>
      <h4>When will I receive my order?</h4>
      <p>
        We make every effort to get your order to you as quickly as possible.
        Once shipped, most orders will arrive in 4-7 business days for standard
        delivery.
      </p>
      <h4>How can I track my order?</h4>
      <p>
        We will send you a tracking number directly to the email address you
        used upon placing your order. The email with the tracking number is
        separate from your order confirmation email and you will receive it once
        the order has been shipped. Please check your spam folder for this
        notification — if for some reason you don't receive it within 4 business
        days of order placement, please send us an email with the subject line
        “Tracking Inquiry” to mail@atterburyworkshop.com.
      </p>
      <h4>
        My tracking status has not updated. What's going on with my order?
      </h4>
      <p>
        USPS tracking updates are not always updated in real time. Please keep
        checking your tracking status for one week and you should start to see
        updates! After a week, if you don't see an update please send us an
        e-mail with the subject line “Tracking Inquiry” to
        mail@atterburyworkshop.com.
      </p>
      <h3>RETURNS/EXCHANGES/CANCELLATIONS</h3>
      <h4>Can I return an item?</h4>
      <p>
        We want you to be happy with your purchase! With that said, we cannot
        offer returns at this time. If you are unhappy with your purchase please
        send us an e-mail with the subject line "Return" to
        mail@atterburyworkshop. We will try our best to make things right.
      </p>
      <h4>How can I cancel my order?</h4>
      <p>
        As long as your order has not shipped, and it is not a custom order, we
        can cancel your order! Please send an email to
        mail@atterburyworkshop.com with the subject line “Cancel Order” and
        include your order # in the subject line — we'll take care of that for
        you. Refunds are transferred back to the original form of payment and
        will be processed within 48-72 hours of cancellation notification. It
        may take your bank a few additional business days to post the credit to
        your account.
